Extract the "Content" folder in your game directory.  
Example: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\

These are the files you need to play the Frostbite Scenario, if you haven't bought the DLC.  

Currently updated to the 1.199 patch (Heavy Industry), the scenario requires 96mb unpacked.

Tested and running on the original game, with Frostbite DLC disabled from steam settings.

If there are any problems please open a discussion and I will try to solve them.
