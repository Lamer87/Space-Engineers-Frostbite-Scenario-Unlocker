These are the files you need to play the Frostbite Scenario, if you haven't bought the DLC.
If you downloaded the cracked game, you don't need these files.

Currently updated to the 1.199 patch (Heavy Industry), the scenario requires 100mb unpacked.

Tested and running on the original game, with Frostbite DLC disabled from steam settings.

If there are any problems please contact me and I will try to solve them.
